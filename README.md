# EsoPaLa

---
The name of the language is an acronym and stands for esoteric pattern (matcher) language.
Like the name suggests EsoPaLa is an esoteric programming language that explores the possibilities of using text patterns to write programs.
Instead of writing `a = 10` you write e.g. `let (a) be equal to (10).`. In the project files are a couple of examples (including bubble and merge sort).

At this point in time the language supports the following data types:
- numbers
- booleans
- strings
- lists
- objects

Ideas for future features are:

- allowing multiple variations of a pattern to be represented by a single class
- allowing (simple) repetition in the pattern to generalize e.g. the creation of lists to support multiple values in one class
- convert the list to an annotation processor that collects the annotations and combines them into a list to reduce maintenance overhead
